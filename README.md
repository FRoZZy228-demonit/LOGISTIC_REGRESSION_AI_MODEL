## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FRoZZy228-demonit/LOGISTIC_REGRESSION_AI_MODEL.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd LOGISTIC_REGRESSION_AI_MODEL
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installing the necessary packages, you can start using the logistic regression model. Follow these steps:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Train the model.
4. Evaluate the results.

For a detailed guide, check the `main.py` file in the repository.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and focuses on cyber threats. It includes various features that help in predicting whether a given instance represents a threat or not. 

You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

### Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, data preprocessing is crucial. The following steps are included:

- Handling missing values
- Normalizing features
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## Model Architecture

The logistic regression model consists of the following components:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts features from the dataset.
- **Logistic Function**: Applies the logistic function to map predicted values between 0 and 1.
- **Output Layer**: Provides the final prediction.

The model uses a simple architecture, which is easy to understand and modify.

## Training the Model

To train the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script will handle data loading, preprocessing, and model training. You can monitor the training process through printed logs.

## Evaluation

Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance using the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This will generate metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, helping you understand how well the model performs.
